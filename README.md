# p100_Cohort_Analysis
In this project I did a cohort analysis, calculating retention rates, ROMI, LTV and CAC.

The language I used for this is **Python**, some of the libraries I used are *pandas*, *matplotlib* and *seaborn*.

I recommed viewing the notebook directly on nbviewer to make sure that it is rendered correctly and the hyperlinks work:
